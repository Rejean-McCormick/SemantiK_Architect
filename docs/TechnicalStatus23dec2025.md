### 📋 Technical Reality Check: SemantiK Architect (v2.0)

**Overall Status:** **Functional Beta**.
The engine runs, the pipes connects, and the "Brain" (Matrix) sees everything. But the "Content" is spotty, and performance has known bottlenecks.

### 🟢 What Actually Works (The Green Zone)

**1. The Plumbing (Infrastructure)**

* **Hexagonal Isolation:** The separation is real. You can swap the file system or Redis without breaking the core linguistic logic.


* **The "Everything Matrix" Scanner:** This is the most mature part. The indexer script successfully scans the file system, and the Next.js frontend successfully visualizes the 14 health blocks. It correctly identifies which languages are broken.
* 
**Tier 1 Grammars (RGL):** For high-resource languages (English, Finnish, French), the system produces industrial-grade text with complex morphology (cases, genders).


* 
**Docker/WSL Hybrid:** The split between Windows (Frontend) and Linux (Backend/GF) is stable and documented.



**2. The New "Dual-Path" Fix**

* **Prototyping:** As of our last coding session, the API now accepts `UniversalNode`. You can now successfully "hallucinate" new functions (e.g., `mkIsAProperty`) without the validator crashing. This unblocked your drafting phase.

### 🔴 What Doesn't Work Yet (The Red Zone)

**1. The "Q42" Fallback Problem (Lexicon Gaps)**

* **The Issue:** The architecture assumes `morphodict` or `people.json` has every word. It doesn't.
* **The Symptom:** When a word is missing, the engine falls back to the raw string. You will see output like *"Q42 lives in Paris"* instead of *"Douglas Adams lives in Paris"*.


* **Severity:** High. This makes the output unreadable for end-users in many languages.

**2. Cold Start Latency**

* **The Issue:** The PGF binary is massive. Loading `AbstractWiki.pgf` into RAM takes significant time (10-60s) and consumes 500MB+ per worker.


* **The Symptom:** The first request after a deploy hangs. Scaling workers is memory-expensive.

**3. Tier 3 Reliability (The AI Gamble)**

* **The Issue:** For the ~60 low-resource languages (Tier 3), you rely on the "Architect Agent" (LLM) and "Weighted Topology".
* **The Symptom:** AI is probabilistic. It sometimes generates valid GF code, but often requires the "Surgeon" agent to fix it in a loop. It is not "fire and forget"; it is "fire and pray."
* **Matrix Reality:** The Matrix shows 79 languages, but the documentation admits only ~12 are "Production Ready". That means **67 languages are likely stubs or broken.**

**4. API Security**

* **The Issue:** The API is currently wide open. There is no Authorization Bearer layer (OAuth2/JWT) implemented yet.


* **The Symptom:** Anyone with access to port 8000 can trigger expensive compilations.

### 🟡 The "Kind of Works" (Yellow Zone)

**1. Ninai Compatibility**

* 
**Status:** The *Adapter* exists and parses the JSON tree.


* **But:** It is currently a strictly mechanical translation. It doesn't yet handle the full semantic nuance of Abstract Wikipedia's Z-Objects, just the structural shape.

**2. The "Surgeon" (Self-Healing)**

* **Status:** It can catch compilation errors and try to patch them.
* **But:** It has a `MAX_RETRIES` limit. If the AI fails 3 times, the language is dropped. It is not a magic wand; it's a retry loop with a smart guesser.

### Summary Verdict

You have built a **Ferrari Engine** (GF/Python) inside a **Professional Garage** (Matrix/Docker), but you are currently driving it with **Empty Gas Tanks** (Missing Lexicon) for most languages.

**Next Immediate Step:** Focus on **Data Injection** (Lexicon), not more Architecture. You need to fill those empty "Health Blocks" in the Matrix.
